# Microsoft anti-malware analysis

As new Scala CLI are (wrongly) assumed to be PUA (potentially unwanted applications) by Microsoft Defender SmartScreen 
on Windows, we need to submit them for analysis to Microsoft after release.

Note: the analysis may take time, and the results may not be immediately available. 
Sometimes it's days, sometimes it's weeks.
It may even occur that the new release gets analysed while the previous one is still in the pipeline 
due to reasons unknown to us. 
As those eventually do pull through, we can't do much about it.

## Submitting a file for analysis

After going through the [release procedure](release-procedure.md), we need to submit the MSI installer for analysis.
Download the `scala-cli-x86_64-pc-win32.msi` and upload it using this [service](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/wdsi/filesubmission).

You will need to log in using your company account authorised by the VirtusLab IT division. 
If you don't have one or if the one you do have doesn't have the right permissions 
(even though you are a maintainer of the Scala CLI repository), be sure to reach out to IT.

## Submission form

When reaching https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/wdsi/filesubmission, you will be presented with a form to fill out.
