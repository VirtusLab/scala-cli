# Scala CLI as implementation for `scala` command

Scala CLI is designed to be a replacement for script that is currently installed as `scala`. Since Scala CLI is feature-packed we do not want to expose all of the features and options to the whole Scala public at the very start. Why is that?
 - We want to make sure that the options / commands are stable
 - We do not want to overwhelm users with multiple options and commands
 - We want to make sure that the commands we add to `scala` are stable so once we commited to supporting given option it may be hard to remove it later

That is why we built in a mechanism to limit the commands, options, directives based if Scala CLI is run as `scala` or `scala-cli`. Mainly for SIP submission we have prepared a pages with supported [options](./cli-options.md), [commands](./commands.md) and [using directives](./directives.md) when running Scala CLI as `scala` or `scala-cli-sip`.

## Testing Scala CLI as `scala`

There are two recommended ways to test and use Scala CLI:

- with brew:

```bash
brew install virtuslab/scala-experimental/scala
```

- with coursier:

```bash
cs setup
cs install scala-experimental ‚Üê this command will replace the default scala runner
```

Alternatively, you can rename your `scala-cli` executable or alias it as `scala`
