Scala Native only works with Scala `2.13.x` and `2.12.x` however we recommend using `2.13.x`.

This page is currently a work in progress, but here are some initial notes:

- Scala Native requires the LLVM toolchain; see requirements on Scala Native website
- Enable via the command-line using `--native`
- Beware platform dependencies
- `compile` / `run` / `test` / `package` should all work
