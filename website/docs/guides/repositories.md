Scala CLI downloads the dependencies declared in your projects using [Coursier](https://get-coursier.io/).
The default repositories being searched are the Maven Central and local Ivy repository on your machine.
If additional repositories are required it is possible to declare them:
- on the command line with `--repository` or `--repo` or just `-r`
- with the `//> using repositories` directive

The values can be names of predefined repositories accepted by Coursier, some of which are:
- `sonatype:_value_` and `sonatype-s01:_value_` for Sonatype servers e.g. `sonatype:snapshots`
    snapshots from both servers are searched when using `snapshots`
- `jitpack`
- `m2Local`

## Custom repositories

Supplying the address of custom repositories is also accepted when using `--repository` or `//> using repositories`.
To do so, provide the URL to the repository's root, e.g. `https://maven.pkg.github.com/USER/REPO` for GitHub Package Registry.
By default, custom repositories are treated as Maven repositories, to specify an Ivy repository, prefix the address with `ivy:` and supply the ivy pattern at the end e.g. `ivy:http://localhost:8081/repository/ivy-releases/[defaultPattern]`.

:::tip
`[defaultPattern]` gets expanded by Coursier to: 
```text
    [organisation]/[module]/(scala_[scalaVersion]/)(sbt_[sbtVersion]/)[revision]/[type]s/[artifact](-[classifier]).[ext]
```

## Repository Authentication

:::caution
Even though the `config` command is not restricted, some available configuration keys may be, and thus may
require setting the `--power` option to be used.
That includes the configuration key tied to repositories settings, like `repositories.credentials` and others.
You can pass the `--power` option explicitly or set it globally by running:
```bash ignore
scala-cli config power true
```
:::

Repository authentication is also supported and there are a couple ways of using it:
- specifying credentials for each host in `COURSIER_CREDENTIALS` environment variable or in the `coursier.credentials` java property ([read more here](/docs/guides/java-properties.md)),
    the supported format in this case is `host-address username:password`, e.g. `my_domain.com MyUserName:myPasswOrd`
- adding config entries for each host, this can be done using `scala-cli --power config repositories.credentials host _username_ _password_`,
    username and password values should follow the [password option format](/docs/reference/password-options.md), e.g. 
```bash ignore
  scala-cli --power config repositories.credentials maven.pkg.github.com value:PrivateToken env:GH_TOKEN
```

## Default repositories

You can override the default Coursier repositories globally by invoking:
```bash ignore
scala-cli --power config repositories.default https://first-repo.company.com https://second-repo.company.com
```

## HTTP proxies

:::caution
Even though the `config` command is not restricted, some available configuration keys may be, and thus may
require setting the `--power` option to be used.
That includes configuration keys tied to setting up proxies, like `httpProxy.address` and others.
You can pass the `--power` option explicitly or set it globally by running:
```bash ignore
scala-cli config power true
```
:::

### Configuration

If you can only download artifacts through a proxy, you need to configure it beforehand, like
```bash ignore
scala-cli --power config httpProxy.address http://proxy.company.com
```

Replace `proxy.company.com` by the address of your proxy.

Change `http://` to `https://` if your proxy is accessible via HTTPS.

### Authentication

If your proxy requires authentication, set your user and password with
```bash ignore
scala-cli --power config httpProxy.user value:_encoded_user_
scala-cli --power config httpProxy.password value:_encoded_password_
```

Replace `_encoded_user_` and `_encoded_password_` by your actual user and password, following
the [password option format](/docs/reference/password-options.md). They should typically look like
`env:ENV_VAR_NAME`, `file:/path/to/file`, or `command:command to run`.

## Mirrors

If you're fine directly downloading artifacts from the internet, but would rather have some
repositories requests go through a repository of yours, configure mirror repositories, like
```bash ignore
scala-cli --power config repositories.mirrors https://repo1.maven.org/maven2=https://repository.company.com/maven
```

To have all requests to a Maven repository go through a repository of yours, do
```bash ignore
scala-cli --power config repositories.mirrors maven:*=https://repository.company.com/maven
```
