This section covers aspects of Scala CLI that apply across various commands.
The guides cover many aspects that are quite detailed that, so we recommend starting at these points:

- [Configuration guide](./configuration.md) - to learn how to configure various options, and what configuration styles are best for each use case
- [IDE guide](./ide.md) - how to import and use Scala CLI-based projects in your favorite IDE
- [`using` directives guide](./using-directives.md) - Scala CLIâ€™s experimental syntax that lets you store configuration information in `.scala` or `.sc` files
- [Scala.js](./scala-js.md) and [Scala Native](./scala-native.md) guides - to learn how Scala CLI supports these non-JVM platforms
- [sbt/mill export](./sbt-mill.md) guide - to learn how to convert your Scala CLI project into an sbt or mill project (when you need a more powerful build tool)
- [Scripting guide](./scripts.md) - covers how Scala CLI allows for powerful scripting with Scala
