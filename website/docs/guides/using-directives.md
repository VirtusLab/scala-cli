:::warning
`using` directives is an experimental language extension that may change in future versions of Scala CLI.
:::

The `using` directives mechanism lets you define configuration information within `.scala` source code files, eliminating the need for build tools to define a dedicated configuration syntax.

`using` directives are basically key-value pairs that let you provide multiple values to a single key. For instance, this command:

```scala
using foo bar baz
```

will be interpreted as assigning `bar` and `baz` to the key `foo`.

As shown, `using` directives can be defined using the special keyword `using`. However, this may not be compatible with exisiting tools outside of Scala CLI. Therefore, they can be used in comments:

```scala
// using scala 2
```

Or as a special top-level annotation:

```scala
@using jars libs/model.jar
```

:::info
For now we recommend using the comment-flavor (`// using scala 3.0.2`), and we will use that syntax in this guide.

Until `using` directives becomes a part of the Scala specification, this is the only way that guarantees that your code will work well with IDEs, code formatters, and other tools.

## Details

`using` directives can be only declared **before any other Scala code**:

```scala
// using scala 2.13
// using scala-js
// using options -Xasync

// package statements, import statements and other code follows ...
```

`using` directives contribute settings to the whole compilation scope where a given `.scala` file is defined.
This means that a library or compiler option defined in one file applies to the whole application or test (depending on whether the source file is a test, or not).

The only exceptions are `using target` directives, which only apply to the given file.
`using target` is a marker to assign a given file to a given target (e.g., test or main sources).

**We believe that syntax similar to `using` directives should become a part of Scala in the future.**

## `using` directives in the Scala CLI

Below is a list of the most important `using` directives that Scala CLI supports. The full list can be found in the [Reference section of this documentation](./reference/directives.md).

- `// using scala <scala-version>` - defines version of Scala used
- `// using lib org::name:version` - defines dependency to given library [more in dedicated guide](./guides/dependencies.md)
- `// using resource <file-or-dir>` - marks file/directory as resources. Resources accessible at runtime and packaged together with compiled code.
- `// using java-opt <opt>` - use given java options when running application or tests
- `// using target [test|main]` used to marked or unmarked given source as test
- `// using test-framework` - select test framework to use

There are several reasons that we believe `using` directives are a good solution:

- One of the main Scala CLI use cases is prototyping, and the ability to ship one or more source code files with a complete configuration is a game-changer for this use case.
- Defining dependencies and other settings is common in Ammonite scripts as well.
- From a teaching perspective, the ability to provide pre-configured pieces of code that fit into one slide is also benefical.
- Having configuration close to the code is benefical, since often — especially in small programs — the given depencencies are only used within one source file.

We acknowledge that configuration distributed across many source files may be hard to maintain in the long term. Therefore, in the near feature we will introduce a set of lints to ensure that above a given project size or complexity, all configuration details will be centralized.

How can configuration that’s contained in source files be centralized?
`using` directives can be placed in any `.scala` file, so it’s possible to create a `.scala` file that contains only configuration information.
Therefore, when your project needs to centralize its configuration, we recommend creating a `conf.scala` file, and placing the configuration there.
We plan to add ways to Scala CLI to migrate these settings into a centralized location with one command or click.

We are aware that `using` directives may be a controversial topic, so we’ve created a [dedicated space for discussing `using` directives](https://github.com/VirtusLab/scala-cli/discussions/categories/using-directives-and-cmd-configuration-options).
