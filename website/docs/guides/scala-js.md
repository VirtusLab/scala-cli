Scala CLI can compile, run, test, and package Scala.JS sources.

One caveat is that Scala CLI doesn't have support for JS linkers (such as [webpack](https://webpack.js.org))
like [scalajs-bundler](https://github.com/scalacenter/scalajs-bundler) has.
For this, you'll have to handle linking yourself, with the `.js` file generated by `scala-cli`.

In order to run Scala.JS sources, `node` is required.

## Configuration

Enable Scala.JS support by passing `--js` to `scala-cli`, such as:

```scala
scala Test.scala --js
```

## Dependencies

This section is currently a work in progress, but here are some initial notes:

- Beware platform dependencies
- `run` / `test` / `package` should all work
