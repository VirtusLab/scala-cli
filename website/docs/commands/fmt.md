Scala-cli supports formatting your code using [Scalafmt](https://scalameta.org/scalafmt/):

```bash
scala-cli fmt
```

Under the hood, `scala-cli` downloads and runs Scalafmt on your code.

If youâ€™re setting up a continuous integration (CI) server, `scala-cli` also has you covered.
You can check formatting correctness using a `--check` flag:

```bash
scala-cli fmt --check
```

### Dialects 

Scala-cli also supports dialects that are passed to the formatter.
This value is only used if there is no `.scalafmt.conf` file.
However, if it exists, then all configuration should be placed there.
For a list of all possible values, consult the [official Scala Dialects documentation](https://scalameta.org/scalafmt/docs/configuration.html#scala-dialects):

```bash
scala-cli fmt --dialect scala212
```

### Scalafmt version

At this time, `scala-cli` read a `scalafmt` version from `.scalafmt.conf` files. If the version is missing, `scala-cli` throws an error, that user should declare explicitly the Scalafmt version. From Scalafmt `3.5.0` it is a mandatory parameter.

To configure the Scalafmt version add the following config into `.scalafmt.conf`. For example, to set version `3.5.0` you should add the following line:

```
version = "3.5.0"
```
