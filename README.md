Scala CLI is a command-line tool to interact with the Scala language. It lets you compile, run, test, and package your
Scala code. (and more!) It shares some similarities with build tools, but it doesn't aim at supporting multi-module
projects, nor to be extended via a task system.

As of Scala 3.5.0, Scala CLI has become the official `scala` runner of the language (for more information 
refer to [SIP-46](https://github.com/scala/improvement-proposals/pull/46)). For more details on using Scala CLI
via the `scala` command, refer to [this doc](https://scala-cli.virtuslab.org/docs/reference/scala-command/).
